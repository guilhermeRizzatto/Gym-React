# Gym-React
Front End version to SpringBoot-Jpa-Gym project
<a href=https://academyservice.com.br> Site link to take a look </a>

If you want to see the backend project: <a href=github.com/guilhermeRizzatto/SpringBoot-Jpa-Gym> SpringBoot-Jpa-Gym </a>

*It was made with React and too much effort, because I saw only one tutorial, and this tutorial was very simple, so the other things that I needed to implement, I had to search on Google, forums, videos, etc.* <br>
<br>
The tutorial that I saw: https://youtu.be/o82GiIk9SX0?si=dmlvk8XID6AUxJHz, this video teaches how to do a project with Spring Boot and React, I saw only the React videos because I already know how to with Spring Boot.

**OBS: The site has no members, trainers, etc, because my backend is no longer hosted in any Cloud System, Now I use LocalTunnel to connect with my localhost backend, so if you want to test with members, trainers, etc, send me a message.**
